              Hi! I'm a software developer currently studying computer science in Vancouver, I have a passion for
              software engineering and design. Having years of experience in OOP and web development
              I'm always open and eager to learn new things such as new tech stacks computer vision models, AI models and
              data analytics. I enjoy working and collaborating with other people in projects and hackathons but also 
              outside the tech field. I like to play extracurricular sports and listen and play music with others as well!
